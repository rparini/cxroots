    A generator which at each step takes a contour and either finds all
    the zeros of f within it or subdivides it further.  Based on the
    algorithm in [KB]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    original_contour : :class:`Contour <cxroots.contour.Contour>`
        The contour which bounds the region in which all the roots of
        f(z) are sought.
    f : function
        A function of a single complex variable, z, which is analytic
        within the contour and has no poles or roots on the contour.
    df : function, optional
        A function of a single complex variable which is the derivative
        of the function f(z). If df is not given then it will be
        approximated with a finite difference formula.
    guess_roots : list, optional
        A list of known roots or guesses for roots (they are checked
        before being accepted).
    guess_roots_symmetry : function, optional
        A function of a single complex variable, z, which returns a list
        of all points which are expected to be roots of f, given that z
        is a root of f.
    newton_step_tol : float, optional
        The required accuracy of the root.  The iterative method used to
        give a final value for each root will exit if the step size, dx,
        between sucessive iterations satisfies abs(dx) < newton_step_tol
        and refine_roots_beyond_tol is False.
    refine_roots_beyond_tol : bool, optional
        If True then the iterative method used to refine the roots will
        exit when error of the previous iteration, x0, was at least as
        good as the current iteration, x, in the sense that
        abs(f(x)) >= abs(f(x0)) and the previous iteration satisfied
        abs(dx0) < newton_step_tol.  In this case the preivous iteration
        is returned as the approximation of the root.
    newton_max_iter : int, optional
        The iterative method used to give a final value for each root
        will exit if the number of iterations exceeds newton_max_iter.
    root_err_tol : float, optional
        A complex value z is considered a root if abs(f(z)) < root_err_tol
    abs_tol : float, optional
        Absolute error tolerance used by the contour integration.
    rel_tol : float, optional
        Relative error tolerance used by the contour integration.
    integer_tol : float, optional
        A number is considered an integer if it is within integer_tol of
        an integer.  Used when determing if the value for the number of
        roots within a contour and the values of the computed
        multiplicities of roots are acceptably close to integers.
    int_abs_tol : float, optional
        The absolute error tolerance used for the contour integration
        when determining the number of roots within a contour.  Since
        the result of this integration must be an integer it can be much
        less accurate than usual.
    M : int, optional
        If the number of roots (including multiplicites) within a contour
        is greater than M then the contour is subdivided further.  M must
        be greater than or equal to the largest multiplcity of any root.
    err_stop : float, optional
        The number of distinct roots within a contour, n, is determined
        by checking if all the elements of a list of contour integrals
        involving formal orthogonal polynomials are sufficently close to
        zero, ie. that the absolute value of each element is < err_stop.
        If err_stop is too large/small then n may be smaller/larger than
        it actually is.
    int_method : {'quad', 'romb'}, optional
        If 'quad' then :func:`scipy.integrate.quad` is used to perform the
        integral.  If 'romb' then Romberg integraion, using
        :func:`scipy.integrate.romb`, is performed instead.  Typically, quad is
        the better choice but it requires that the real and imaginary
        parts of each integral are calculated sepeartely, in addition,
        if df is not provided, 'quad' will require additional function
        evaluations to approximate df at each point that f is evaluated
        at.  If evaluating f is expensive then 'romb' may be more
        efficient since it computes the real and imaginary parts
        simultaniously and if df is not provided it will approximate it
        using only the values of f that would be required by the
        integration routine in any case.
    div_min : int, optional
        If the Romberg integration method is used then div_min is the
        minimum number of divisions before the Romberg integration
        routine is allowed to exit.
    div_max : int, optional
        If the Romberg integration method is used then div_max is the
        maximum number of divisions before the Romberg integration
        routine exits.
    df_approx_order : int, optional
        Only used if df=None and method='quad'.  The argument order=df_approx_order is
        passed to :func:`numdifftools.Derivative` and is the order of the error
        term in the Taylor approximation.  df_approx_order must be even.

    Yields
