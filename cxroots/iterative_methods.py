    Starting with initial point x0 iterate to a root of f. This function is called
    during the rootfinding process to refine any roots found. If df is given then
    the Newton-Raphson method, :func:`~cxroots.IterativeMethods.newton`, will be used,
    otherwise Muller's method, :func:`~cxroots.IterativeMethods.muller`, will be used
    instead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x0 : complex
        An initial point for the iteration.
    f : function
        Function of a single variable which we seek to find a root of.
    df : function, optional
        The derivative of f.
    step_tol: float, optional
        The routine ends if the step size, dx, between sucessive
        iterations satisfies abs(dx) < step_tol and attempt_best is False.
    root_tol: float, optional
        The routine ends if abs(f(x)) < root_tol and attempt_best is False.
    max_iter : int, optional
        The routine ends after max_iter iterations.
    attempt_best : bool, optional
        If True then routine ends if the error of the previous iteration,
        x0, was at least as good as the current iteration, x, in the
        sense that abs(f(x)) >= abs(f(x0)) and the previous iteration
        satisfied either abs(dx0) < step_tol or abs(f(x0)) < root_tol.  In
        this case the previous iteration is returned as the approximation
        of the root.
    callback : function, optional
        After each iteration callback(x, dx, f(x), iteration) will be
        called where 'x' is the current iteration of the estimated root,
        'dx' is the step size between the previous and current 'x' and
        'iteration' the number of iterations that have been taken.  If
        the callback function evaluates to True then the routine will end.

    Returns
    -------
    complex
        An approximation for a root of f.  If the rootfinding was
        unsucessful then None will be returned instead.
