	"""
	Starting with initial point x0 iterate to a root of f. This function 
	is called during the rootfinding process to refine any roots found.
	If df is given then the Newton-Raphson method, :func:`~cxroots.IterativeMethods.newton`,
	will be used, otherwise Muller's method, :func:`~cxroots.IterativeMethods.muller`, will be used instead.

	Parameters
	----------
	x0 : complex
		An initial point for the iteration.
	f : function
		Function of a single variable which we seek to find a root of.
	df : function, optional
		The derivative of f.
	steptol: float, optional
		The routine ends if the step size, dx, between sucessive
		iterations satisfies abs(dx) < steptol and attemptBest is False.
	roottol: float, optional
		The routine ends if abs(f(x)) < roottol and attemptBest is False.
	maxIter : int, optional
		The routine ends after maxIter iterations.
	attemptBest : bool, optional
		If True then routine ends if the error of the previous iteration, 
		x0, was at least as good as the current iteration, x, in the 
		sense that abs(f(x)) >= abs(f(x0)) and the previous iteration 
		satisfied either abs(dx0) < steptol or abs(f(x0)) < roottol.  In 
		this case the previous iteration is returned as the approximation 
		of the root.
	callback : function, optional
		After each iteration callback(x, dx, f(x), iteration) will be 
		called where 'x' is the current iteration of the estimated root, 
		'dx' is the step size between the previous and current 'x' and 
		'iteration' the number of iterations that have been taken.  If 
		the callback function evaluates to True then the routine will end.

	Returns
	-------
	complex
		An approximation for a root of f.  If the rootfinding was 
		unsucessful then None will be returned instead.
